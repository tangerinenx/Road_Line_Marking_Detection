# Road_Line_Marking_Detection
My Bachelor's Final Project: LANE DETECTION AND ROAD LINE MARKING IDENTIFICATION FOR AUTONOMOUS CAR USING SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

I differentiate the meaning of dashed line and the solid/continue line when get detected by the system. The training and testing dataset was all Jakarta, Indonesian's road.

I also make a comparisson of using Wiener Filter on both architecture applied to the training images. For further information, free to contact me.
